librarian
=========

The librarian code system is very much a work in progress on generating documentation. It is currently only tackling documentation for modules and the result is raw.

Testing it
----------

Use <code>refresh</code> to force the watcher server to watch the librarian file and to update that file. It will hold the generated documentation of the module *0-layout* of **my-systems**.
